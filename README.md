# colormap

A simple, free tool for coloring in a map using your own legend. This can be used to do things like show places you've been, display data in a geographical way, or anything else you could do with a map that you color in yourself.

Check it out at [colormap.app](https://colormap.app)

## Using the map

Currently we offer two layers, ready to go. US counties and US states. There is no UI to toggle between these yet, but you can do so via the URL. 

[To use our counties layer, go here](https://colormap.app?type=us_counties_2023.geojson)

[To use our states layer, go here](https://colormap.app?type=us_states_2024.geojson)

**Warning**: Toggling between the two will clear any progress made 

## Pre-release disclaimer

This app is currently under active development and changing rapidly. Things may break or suddenly be different than before. Additionally, there will be many more features to come.
